<p>
    As a full-time mother and a pharmacist by 
    profession, The demands of 
    my career does not provide me with the 
    flexibility I need to raise my son. However, 
    my husband and his friends, who are software 
    engineers, inspired me to explore the world of 
    coding. Witnessing their passion for technology 
    and the flexibility that a career in software 
    engineering offers, I decided to take a leap of 
    faith and pursue a new career path in coding.
